title: Draw a 3D heart in browser

---

Valentine's Day is approaching. Let's have some fun.

First, we all know that `mathematica` can draw a beautiful
3d heart with only one single command:

```
ContourPlot3D[
  320 (-x^2 z^3 - 9 y^2 z^3/80 + (x^2 + 9 y^2/4 + z^2 - 1)^3) == 0,
  {x, -1.3, 1.3}, {y, -1.3, 1.3}, {z, -1.3, 1.3}, 
  ContourStyle -> Directive[Red]]
```

Let's save it as a model file with this command:

```
Export["heart.ply", %]
```

We need `blender` to convert it into another format. 
Download it [here](http://www.blender.org/download/get-blender) and 
install `three.js` extension [here](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/master/utils/exporters/blender).

Open `blender` you will see a default cube. 
On the left menu column you will see a `Delete`.    
*Yes! Go you!*   
Then `File` -> `Import` -> `Stanford (.ply)`,
and select our `heart.ply`. You will see it like this.

Next, `File` -> `User Preferences` -> `Addons`,
find a addon named `three.js format` and enable it. 
Then `File` -> `Export` -> `Three.js (.js)` and we will get a `heart.js`. 
It can be imported by `three.js` and shown in browser. 

The final step contains a little more codes 
([github](https://github.com/scturtle/heart))
and [here](http://scturtle.me/heart/heart.html) is the final example.

This model is handy and you can do more romantic things with powerful `three.js`.    
But you have to make sure that she has a "real" browser supporting `webGL`.
