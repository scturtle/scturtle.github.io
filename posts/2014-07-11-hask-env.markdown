title: Minimal Haskell Environment With Latest GHC and Cabal-Install on Windows
tags: haskell
---

Delete old environment if you have `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\cabal` and `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\ghc`.

Download [latest GHC](http://www.haskell.org/ghc/) and unzip it to `C:\Program Files\haskell`.

Add `C:\Program Files\haskell\bin\` into `PATH`.

Get a pre-built [cabal.exe](http://www.haskell.org/cabal/download.html).
And put it into the above path.

Following command are executed under [MSYS](http://www.mingw.org/wiki/msys). `Cygwin` just fails.

Get packages list from hackage:
```
$ cabal update
```
If it tells you to `cabal install cabal-install`, don't believe it :)

We first get a right version of cabal and then the latest cabal-install:
```
$ cabal install cabal
$ export PATH="/c/Program Files/haskell/perl":"/c/Program Files/haskell/mingw/bin":$PATH
$ cabal install cabal-install
```

Replace our original `cabal.exe` by the one built in `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\cabal\bin\`.
Also add the above path into `PATH`.

Now we have the latest `GHC` and `Cabal-Install` :)
